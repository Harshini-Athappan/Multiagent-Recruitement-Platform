A fully functional multi-agent AI recruitment pipeline built with LangChain, Groq LLMs, and FastAPI. It automates the end-to-end hiring workflow through a conversational interface.

Pipeline Flow

JD_INTAKE → CANDIDATE_SEARCH → SCORING → SCHEDULING
    → FEEDBACK → OFFER → EVALUATION → COMPLETED
    
Stage	Agent	Responsibility
1	JD Agent	Parse PDF/text/NL job descriptions into structured JSON
2	Candidate Search Agent	Source candidates with ≥40% skill match
3	Scoring Agent	Score candidates 0-100 using weighted rubric
4	Scheduling Agent	Schedule interviews with conflict detection
5	Feedback Agent	Collect feedback, sentiment analysis, hire/no-hire
6	Offer Agent	Draft personalised offer letters with salary validation
7	Evaluation Agent	Pipeline audit, metrics, closure report
⚙️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites: Python 3.11+

Clone and navigate:

git clone https://github.com/{your-org}/recruitment-platform.git
cd recruitment-platform

Setup virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure environment:

# Create .env file and add your GROQ_API_KEY
# Ensure API_PORT=8016 is set
Run the services (in separate terminals):

Terminal 1 (Backend):

python run.py
# API lives at http://localhost:8016
Terminal 2 (Frontend):

streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# UI lives at http://localhost:8501
📥 Required Inputs per Stage
To successfully navigate the autonomous pipeline, the following inputs are required at each step:

Stage	Input Type	Description
1. JD Intake	Text or PDF	Paste the Job Description or upload a file to start.
2. Search	Automatic	AI searches the internal database for matches.
3. Scoring	Automatic	AI scores candidates. Review the rankings.
4. Scheduling	Approval	Click "Confirm & Send Invites" to book the proposed slots.
5. Feedback	Form	Enter Interviewer Name, Ratings (1-10), and raw review text for each candidate.
6. Offer	Decision	Review the Sentiment and Draft. Click "Send Final Offer" or provide text adjustments (e.g. "Add $10k bonus").
7. Eval	Review	AI generates the closure report and finishes the pipeline.
🚀 Interactive Usage & Testing
Streamlit UI (Primary Interface)
The easiest way to use the platform is through the Streamlit dashboard:

Open http://localhost:8501

- Use the "➕ Start New Recruitment Role" button in the sidebar to begin a pipeline.
- Paste a job description in the text box and follow the autonomous conversational flow.
- Interact with the LLM directly through the chat input at the bottom to progress/approve stages (e.g., type "approve" when prompted).
- Switch between multiple active roles using the sidebar dashboard.
- FastAPI Swagger (API Testing)

You can test the headless endpoints directly via Swagger:

- Open http://localhost:8016/docs
- Use POST /jd/text to submit a Job Description. Copy the returned pipeline_id.
- Use POST /chat with {"pipeline_id": "...", "message": "proceed"} to advance the multi-agent pipeline.
- View pipeline state and metrics using the GET /pipelines and GET /pipelines/{id}/status endpoints.

🔑 Key Design Decisions

- LangChain for Orchestration
- ChatGroq via langchain-groq for all LLM calls
- SystemMessage / HumanMessage for structured prompting
- Supervisor uses LLM for intent classification, then deterministic routing
- Each agent maintains its own conversation context
- Groq LLM (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
- Fast inference (< 2s per agent call typical)
- Free tier sufficient for development
- Model configurable via .env
- State Management
- PipelineState Pydantic model as single source of truth
- Thread-safe in-memory store (PipelineStore)
- Full conversation history per pipeline
- Stage history tracking for audit
- Scoring Rubric (deterministic)
- Overall Score = 0.40 × Skill Match
              + 0.30 × Experience Match
              + 0.15 × Education Match
              + 0.15 × Preferred Skills
              
Conflict Detection
- 15-minute buffer between consecutive interviews
- Business hours: Mon–Fri, 09:00–18:00
- Auto-propose 3 alternatives on conflict


🔮 Production Roadmap
- PostgreSQL / Redis backend for state persistence
- OAuth2 authentication
- ATS integration (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday)
- Email notifications (SendGrid/SES)
- Calendar integration (Google Calendar API)
- React dashboard frontend
- LangGraph for complex multi-step workflows
- Async job queue (Celery + Redis)
